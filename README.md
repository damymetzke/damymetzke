## Damy Metzke

Hello there!
I am a passionate programmer.
Currently I'm doing a lot of web development.
I'm planning to got into video game development in the near future.

While I think technical skills are important,
there is only so much one can do by themselves.
I believe programming should be seen as a social skill first and foremost.

I'm currently looking for FOSS project I can contribute to,
and will do so if I can find the time.
